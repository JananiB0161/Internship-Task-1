Task 1: Big Data Analysis Using PySpark

Project Title: Pixar Films – Big Data Analysis

Description of What I Did:

For Task 1 of the internship, I performed a Big Data analysis using a dataset of Pixar Films. The goal was to demonstrate how to work with large datasets using scalable tools. Since traditional tools like Excel can struggle with large files, I used PySpark, which is designed for handling big data efficiently.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Python (via Anaconda)

Jupyter Notebook

PySpark

Dataset: Pixar Films (CSV file)

Steps I Followed:

Installed PySpark using the command !pip install pyspark inside Jupyter Notebook.

Loaded the Pixar dataset using PySpark's read.csv() function.

Displayed the first few rows of data using df.show(5) to understand what’s in the file.

Checked the structure and data types of each column using df.printSchema().

Counted the total number of movies in the dataset using df.count().

Grouped and counted movies by IMDB Score using groupBy().count().show() to gain simple insights.

Insights Found:

The dataset contained information about all Pixar movies including their budget, box office revenue, IMDB ratings, etc.

I was able to explore how many movies had different IMDB scores.

All steps and analysis are saved in a Jupyter Notebook file: Task 1 - Pixar Big Data.ipynb.
